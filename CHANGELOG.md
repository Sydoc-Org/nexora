## [Unreleased]

Test-coverage and dev-tooling work toward 2.5.62. No user-facing behavioural change beyond the 2FA clock-skew fix below.

### Added
- Reporting — **chart & pivot result views.** A Grid / Chart / Pivot toggle
  appears after a run and re-visualizes the current result set (curated *or*
  SQL) in place: Chart.js bar/line/pie/doughnut charts, and a vanilla
  drag-and-drop multi-dimension **pivot/matrix** (drag fields into
  Rows/Columns/Values, per-measure aggregation sum/avg/count/min/max, with row
  and grand totals).
- Reporting — **saved-report load UI.** A "Saved reports" dropdown on the
  builder toolbar with Load / Rename / Delete (the list/get/update/delete
  endpoints already existed); Load restores a curated definition into the
  builder or a SQL definition into the SQL editor.
- Reporting — **Octopus as a 2nd live-SQL target.** The SQL sandbox can target
  the Octopus runtime DB alongside Statistics, gated by the new grantable
  `reporting.sql.target.octopus` permission (migration `0008`, admins seeded)
  and its own dedicated `db_datareader`-only login
  (`DB_REPORTING_OCTO_RO_USER` / `DB_REPORTING_OCTO_RO_PWD`; until set the
  Octopus target degrades to 503).
- Reporting: live read-only **SQL sandbox** (Statistics) — run a single SELECT,
  export to Excel, and save SQL reports. Gated by the new grantable
  `reporting.sql.run` permission plus a one-time acknowledgment, hardened by an
  sqlglot AST gate, a dedicated `db_datareader`-only login, a 50k row cap,
  statement timeout, and per-run audit (`ReportingSqlAudit`).
- **Reporting page** (`/reporting`): internal self-service report builder (PowerBI replacement, phase 1). Curated **Document Processing** source, table visualization with field picker, filters, combine clients/processes, custom column headers, save/load reports, and Excel export. New `reporting.*` permissions; new `Reports` table; new `openpyxl` dependency.
- **`nx --doctor`** preflight health check (`nx_lib/cli_doctor.py`): verifies the Python interpreter, installed packages vs `requirements.txt`, `.env` / `env/<ENV>.env` keys, writable `var/` dirs and translation compile state, all four SQL Server engines + the ODBC driver, pending schema migrations, schema drift vs INT, on-PATH tooling, git hooks, port 8000, and the external services (Microsoft Graph / Octopus / Bexio). `--fast` skips drift + external calls; `--fix` runs safe auto-repairs. Exit code 0 on no failures, 1 otherwise — usable as a preflight gate.
- **`nx -md` / `--maindir`** to cd into the repo (handled by the `$PROFILE` wrapper function), plus a matching `doctor` command in the interactive REPL.
- **`docs/howto/nx.md`** — full nx CLI reference (one-shot flags, interactive REPL, `doctor`).
- **`docs/howto/db-migrations.md`** — detailed database-migration how-to: the two-script model (`db-migrate.py` / `sync-from-db.py`), authoring workflow, `db-migrate.py` flag reference, the `dbo.SchemaMigrations` ledger, recipes, and troubleshooting.
- App logger output captured to `var/logs/system/app.log`.
- **Automated test suite build-out.** pytest unit coverage across the app factory, Flask extensions, request-lifecycle hooks, logging, DB helpers (URL builder + `ping_db` / `ping_dbs_parallel`), security/permissions, i18n locale fallback, maintenance banner/lockout, `PrefixMiddleware`, notifications, the Octopus client, process helpers, and the nx CLI (REPL + doctor). Route-level tests covering every view module (auth, core, dashboard, profile, admin, workitems, invoices, notifications, chat). Playwright E2E browser tests across login / 2FA, dashboard, workitems, invoices, chat, profile, admin, and misc pages, with a cross-browser login smoke. pytest-cov wired in with per-module ratcheting coverage thresholds; test layout, fixtures, and run commands documented under `docs/`.

### Changed
- Route listing (`nx --routes`) moved out of embedded PowerShell into Python (`nx_lib/cli.py::print_routes`) as the single source of truth shared by the one-shot flag and the REPL `routes` command.
- `CLAUDE.md` Databases section: corrected the stale git-hook install step (the non-existent `scripts/install-git-hooks.ps1` → `pre-commit install --install-hooks` / `bootstrap.ps1`) and the pre-commit hook reference (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` → the `sql-migrate-int` / `sql-sync-check` hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
- **`dbo.SearchConfig`:** backfilled `col_targetsystemfilename` for the `elektromaterial`/`privera` process rows via migration `0003_update_col_targetsystemfilename_data_searchconfig.sql`.

### Fixed
- **Reporting — `status` synthetic field removed from catalog:** `fetch_docprocessing_catalog` was injecting `status` as always-available alongside `processname`, but `SearchConfig` has no `col_status` column and the query builder cannot synthesize it. Selecting or filtering on `status` produced all-NULL columns or a `QueryBuildError`. Now only `processname` (fully supported by the builder) is injected; `status` will be offered once a real column backs it.
- **Reporting — empty-cols guard in `_load_field_col_maps`:** added early-return when `SearchConfig` exposes no `col_*` columns, preventing malformed SQL being emitted.
- **Reporting — flatpickr wired for date filter inputs:** `templates/reporting.html` loaded the flatpickr CSS/JS but `_reporting_js.html` never used it. Date/datetime-typed filter fields now initialize a flatpickr calendar picker; the field dropdown re-renders the row (resetting the value input) when changed so the picker activates immediately.
- **2FA:** accept adjacent TOTP windows on verify, tolerating small client/server clock skew.
- **generali-import:** store the full CSV filename in the import log.
- **pre-commit:** exclude `sql/` from the `mixed-line-ending` hook (it already excluded `end-of-file-fixer` / `trailing-whitespace`). The auto-generated dumps are CRLF from mssql-scripter and LF-normalized by `.gitattributes`, so the fixer perpetually re-flagged them on Windows, blocking commits of any regenerated dump.

### Removed
- **`dbo.SearchConfig`:** dropped 12 unused columns (`col_scanbatchnr`, `col_pid`, `col_personalfileid`, `col_employmentfileid`, `col_doctypeidtargetsystem`, `col_doctypeidsydoc`, `col_registeridtargetsystem`, `col_masterdataseparatorsheettype`, `col_masterdatabirthday`, `col_masterdatafirstname`, `col_masterdatalastname`, `col_masterdataseparatorsheetid`) via migration `0002_remove_unused_columns_searchconfig.sql`.

## [2.5.61] - 2026-05-28

Dev-environment upgrade (10-PR bundle). No behavioural code changes — only structure, tooling, and naming. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-dev-env-upgrade-design.md` for the design and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-dev-env-upgrade.md` for the step-by-step plan.

### Added
- `bootstrap.ps1` one-shot dev-environment setup. Idempotent and re-runnable: detects Python, installs uv if missing, runs `uv sync --extra dev`, installs Playwright chromium, seeds `env/<E>.env` from templates (never overwrites existing), installs pre-commit hooks (pre-commit / commit-msg / pre-push), ensures `var/` subdirs exist, prints a checklist of remaining manual steps. Quick start collapses to `git clone … && .\bootstrap.ps1`.
- `LICENSE` (proprietary Sydoc notice).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file, Keep-a-Changelog format).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — naming, branch, and commit conventions, plus the manual-fallback setup steps for when `bootstrap.ps1` doesn't fit.
- `.editorconfig` for cross-editor consistency.
- `.python-version` pinning Python 3.13.9.
- Modern Python toolchain: uv (deps), ruff (lint + format), mypy (types), pre-commit framework (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`), gitlint commit-msg lint (`.gitlint`). All wired into CI as blocking steps.
- `env/` directory: `INT.env` / `PROD.env` / `STAGING.env` / `TEST.env` (gitignored) plus committed sanitised `env/*.env.example` templates.
- `var/` directory consolidating all runtime data: `uploads/`, `session/`, `logs/`, `screenshots/`, `backups/`, `test-results/`. Only `.gitkeep` markers tracked. Resolved via `nx_lib.config.PATHS`.
- `bin/` directory for dev CLI scripts. Currently holds `bin/nx.ps1`.

### Changed
- `nx.ps1` moved to `bin/nx.ps1` (history preserved via `git mv`). `nx_lib.cli.NX_PS1` updated; the dir is excluded from the prod robocopy mirror.
- All non-root `*.env` files moved under `env/` (`env/INT.env`, `env/PROD.env`, `env/STAGING.env`, `env/TEST.env`). `nx_lib/config.py` now loads from `env/{ENVIRONMENT}.env` with a one-release fallback to the legacy root location (emits a `DeprecationWarning` naming both paths). The root `.env` env-selector stays put. `.gitignore`: `*.env` still ignores secrets everywhere, with a `!env/*.env.example` exception to commit the templates. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` copies `env/PROD.env` (legacy fallback included) and `env/TEST.env` into the workspace `env/`. `scripts/test_db_reset.py` reads `env/TEST.env`. **PROD pre-flight on SYAPP01:** move `D:\sydoc\nexora\{INT,PROD}.env` into `D:\sydoc\nexora\env\` before the 2.5.61 bundle merges; the deploy and the runtime loader both fall back with a warning if you don't.
- Runtime data consolidated under `var/`: `uploads/`, `session/`, `logs/`, `screenshots/`, `backups/`, `test-results/` all moved out of the repo root. All Python writers now resolve their location through `nx_lib.config.PATHS` (e.g. `PATHS.logs`, `PATHS.uploads`), which auto-creates each dir at import time. The ops cleanup scripts (`ops/cleanup/csvLogs_toDB.ps1`, `ops/cleanup/cleanup_expired_sessionFiles.ps1`), pytest output paths (`--junitxml`, `--html`), and the GitHub Actions `test-results` artifact path are all updated. `static/uploads/` (Flask-served public chat assets) stays in place — only private runtime data moves. **PROD follow-up on SYAPP01:** move `D:\sydoc\nexora\{uploads,session,logs,screenshots,backups}\*` into `D:\sydoc\nexora\var\...` so the cron scripts pick up the new path on the next run.
- `scripts/db-migrate.py` `find_sqlcmd()` now falls back to common install dirs (`C:\Program Files\SqlCmd`, the ODBC 17/18 Tools `Binn` dirs) when `shutil.which` can't see `sqlcmd` on the runner's PATH. `deploy.yml` also prepends `C:\Program Files\SqlCmd` to `$env:PATH` in the PROD-migration step. Defensive against the post-install-PATH-isn't-yet-inherited pattern that wedged the 2.5.60 deploy.
- `README.md` quick-start collapses to `.\bootstrap.ps1`; setup details live in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (with manual fallback steps for when bootstrap doesn't fit).
- Dependency management migrated to uv with committed `uv.lock`. `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` are now generated artifacts (kept for the IIS/wfastcgi deploy path).
- Git hooks now managed via the pre-commit framework (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Custom hook scripts under `scripts/git-hooks/` are wrapped as `repo: local` entries to preserve behaviour.
- Conventional Commits enforced via gitlint commit-msg hook (`.gitlint`).
- Python identifiers renamed to snake_case per PEP 8 / ruff rule set N. Notable: `pageVisability` → `page_visibility` (also fixes the long-standing typo); the four DB engine globals (`engineOctoDB`/`engineNexoraDB`/`engineStatisticsDB`/`engineGeneraliDB`) → `engine_octo_db`/`engine_nexora_db`/`engine_statistics_db`/`engine_generali_db`; `getDBUrl` → `get_db_url`; `get_activityinstancesToIgnore` → `get_activity_instances_to_ignore`; the four Generali route handlers (`generali_additionalServices` etc.) → snake_case with the camelCase **endpoint names preserved** via `endpoint=` on `add_url_rule`, so existing `url_for()` callers and templates continue to resolve unchanged. Same endpoint-preservation pattern for `init_2FA` → `init_2fa`.
- Ruff lint and format-check in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` are now blocking (formerly advisory with `continue-on-error: true`).
- Jinja template files renamed to snake_case. All 30 camelCase templates (page templates, JS partials, error base, logo, version footer) renamed in lockstep with their includes / `render_template` callers. Highlights: `templates/admin/{accessControl,adminOverview,userDetail,archive/userManagement}.html` → snake_case; `templates/nexoraLogo/_nexoraLogo.html` → `templates/nexora_logo/_nexora_logo.html` (folder + file); `templates/handlers/_errorBase.html` → `_error_base.html`; all `templates/js/_<page>JS.html` and `templates/js/admin/_<page>JS.html` partials → `_<page>_js.html`; `templates/js/_generali-dashboardJS.html` also normalised hyphen → underscore. `messages.pot` and the three locale `.po` files re-extracted so source-path references match. Template-side identifiers (`pageV` kwargs, `active_page` strings) and the camelCase static CSS assets are intentionally out of scope.

### Removed
- Empty placeholder folders: `cleanup/`, `export-help/`, `generali-import/`, `news/`.
- Deprecated `environment_transfer_queries.tmp.sql` (superseded by `sql/_migrations/`).
- `scripts/install-git-hooks.ps1` — the PR 4 deprecation shim. Use `.venv\Scripts\pre-commit.exe install ...` directly (which the shim was already calling on your behalf).

## [2.5.60] - 2026-05-28
- Repository restructure (PRs #84, #85): `ops/` (prod-scheduled) vs `scripts/` (dev/manual), SQL migrations workflow, branch-name guard.
