## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `LICENSE` (proprietary Sydoc notice)
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with naming, branch, and commit conventions
- `.editorconfig` for cross-editor consistency
- `.python-version` pinning Python 3.13.9

### Removed
- Empty placeholder folders: `cleanup/`, `export-help/`, `generali-import/`, `news/`
- Deprecated `environment_transfer_queries.tmp.sql` (superseded by `sql/_migrations/`)

### Changed
- Runtime data consolidated under `var/`: `uploads/`, `session/`, `logs/`, `screenshots/`, `backups/`, `test-results/` all moved out of the repo root. All Python writers now resolve their location through the new `nx_lib.config.PATHS` namespace (e.g. `PATHS.logs`, `PATHS.uploads`), which auto-creates each dir at import time. `.gitignore` keeps only `.gitkeep` markers under `var/`. The ops cleanup scripts (`ops/cleanup/csvLogs_toDB.ps1`, `ops/cleanup/cleanup_expired_sessionFiles.ps1`), pytest output paths (`--junitxml`, `--html`), and the GitHub Actions `test-results` artifact path are all updated. `static/uploads/` (Flask-served public chat assets) stays in place — only private runtime data moves. **PROD follow-up on SYAPP01:** move `D:\sydoc\nexora\{uploads,session,logs,screenshots,backups}\*` into `D:\sydoc\nexora\var\...` before or right after the deploy lands, so the cron scripts pick up the new path on the next run.
- `scripts/db-migrate.py` `find_sqlcmd()` now falls back to a list of common install dirs (`C:\Program Files\SqlCmd`, the ODBC 17/18 Tools `Binn` dirs) when `shutil.which` can't see `sqlcmd` on the runner's PATH. `deploy.yml` also prepends `C:\Program Files\SqlCmd` to `$env:PATH` in the PROD-migration step. Defensive against the post-install-PATH-isn't-yet-inherited pattern that wedged the 2.5.60 deploy.
- Expanded `README.md` with onboarding overview and quick links
- Dependency management migrated to uv with committed `uv.lock`. `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` are now generated artifacts (kept for the IIS/wfastcgi deploy path).
- Git hooks now managed via the pre-commit framework (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Custom hook scripts under `scripts/git-hooks/` are wrapped as `repo: local` entries to preserve behaviour. `install-git-hooks.ps1` becomes a deprecation shim that calls `pre-commit install` for you.
- Conventional Commits enforced via gitlint commit-msg hook (`.gitlint`).
- Python identifiers renamed to snake_case per PEP 8 / ruff rule set N. Notable: `pageVisability` → `page_visibility` (also fixes the long-standing typo); the four DB engine globals (`engineOctoDB`/`engineNexoraDB`/`engineStatisticsDB`/`engineGeneraliDB`) → `engine_octo_db`/`engine_nexora_db`/`engine_statistics_db`/`engine_generali_db`; `getDBUrl` → `get_db_url`; `get_activityinstancesToIgnore` → `get_activity_instances_to_ignore`; the four Generali route handlers (`generali_additionalServices` etc.) → snake_case with the camelCase **endpoint names preserved** via `endpoint=` on `add_url_rule`, so existing `url_for()` callers and templates continue to resolve unchanged. Same endpoint-preservation pattern for `init_2FA` → `init_2fa`.
- Ruff lint and format-check in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` are now blocking (formerly advisory with `continue-on-error: true`).
- Jinja template files renamed to snake_case. All 30 camelCase templates (page templates, JS partials, error base, logo, version footer) renamed in lockstep with their includes / `render_template` callers. Highlights: `templates/admin/{accessControl,adminOverview,userDetail,archive/userManagement}.html` → snake_case; `templates/nexoraLogo/_nexoraLogo.html` → `templates/nexora_logo/_nexora_logo.html` (folder + file); `templates/handlers/_errorBase.html` → `_error_base.html`; all `templates/js/_<page>JS.html` and `templates/js/admin/_<page>JS.html` partials → `_<page>_js.html`; `templates/js/_generali-dashboardJS.html` also normalised hyphen → underscore. `messages.pot` and the three locale `.po` files re-extracted so source-path references match. Template-side identifiers (`pageV` kwargs, `active_page` strings) and the camelCase static CSS assets are intentionally out of scope.

## [2.5.60] - 2026-05-XX
- Repository restructure (PRs #84, #85): `ops/` (prod-scheduled) vs `scripts/` (dev/manual), SQL migrations workflow, branch-name guard.
